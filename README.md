# Master Thesis: Federated and distributed Machine Learning models for load prediction at the edge

## Overview

This repository contains the PDF of my master thesis, titled "Federated and distributed Machine Learning models for load prediction at the edge." The thesis explores innovative methods in machine learning that address the limitations of traditional centralized approaches by leveraging federated and distributed learning techniques in dynamic urban environments.

## Motivation and Context

Traditional cloud-based approaches for processing data collected from mobile devices face significant challenges. Issues such as privacy concerns, network latency, and increased data transmission loads highlight the need for more sustainable and efficient methods. My thesis proposes and evaluates two federated and distributed ML approaches that aim to overcome these limitations by:

1. **Enhancing Privacy:** By keeping data on local devices and only sharing model updates.
2. **Reducing Latency:** By allowing devices to make predictions locally and in real-time.
3. **Improving Efficiency:** By minimizing data transmission and leveraging local information to enhance model performance.

## Thesis Objectives

The main objectives of the thesis include:

- **Proposing Two Federated Learning Approaches:** These approaches are applied to a network of edge nodes in an urban setting, specifically in Porto, Portugal.
- **Evaluating Performance:** The effectiveness of these approaches is measured in predicting incoming traffic for each edge node under different urban scenarios.

## Research Questions

The thesis addresses the following key questions:

1. Can a distributed and decentralized ML approach improve predictive performance by leveraging information from neighboring nodes?
2. Do federated and distributed approaches outperform isolated models using only local data?

## Contributions

The thesis offers the following contributions:

- Development of two federated and distributed ML approaches that utilize historical data from neighboring nodes to improve prediction accuracy.
- Comparison of these approaches with traditional isolated models to demonstrate their effectiveness in various urban scenarios.
- Exploration of performance improvements and limitations based on different parameters and scenarios.
